Project currently meets the following Code Louisville Python Project requirements:
    1. Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits
    2. Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it.
    3. Implement optical character recognition (OCR) that you can upload PDFs to and it will generate the text
    4. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program. 
 
 
 
Project Overview - 
    This program runs in the console by the command line and provides access to a list of painting titles scraped from my website. Each title, when entered in the command line after the prompt, returns an html link. When the user clicks on the link a new window will open to the web page containing an image of the corresponding painting. 

    The user can continue this process by going down the list from top to bottom and entering (copy/paste) painting titles one at a time into the prompt. 
    
    The user can also enter "TEXT" to view a writing sample generated from a PDF of my graduate thesis (University of Louisville, 2013) and continue in the program. To return to the list of painting titles and start the selection process over the user will enter "LIST".
    
    The user can exit the program at any time by entering "EXIT" in the command line.
