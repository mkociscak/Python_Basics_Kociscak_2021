Overview of the project
    The program runs in the console by the command line and provides access to a list of painting titles scraped from my old website. Each title, when entered in the command line after the prompt, returns a link to a new web page containing the related image.

The master loop provides the options to the user to 1). Enter a painting title (copy/paste from the given list), 2). View the list, and 3). Exit the program.
